# Model-View-Presenter (MVP) 

Welcome to the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) example repository! This repository provides a simple implementation of the MVP architectural pattern, commonly used in software development to separate concerns in a user interface (UI) application.

## Overview

- **MVP Pattern:** The Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Presenter. This separation of concerns makes the codebase more modular, testable, and maintainable.

## Features

This example repository demonstrates the following features:

1. **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic. In this example, the model is the database (in a docker container).

2. **View:** Represents the UI elements and their layout. It is responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions.

3. **Presenter:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It handles user input from the View, processes it using the Model, and updates the View accordingly.

## Usage

To use this example repository to understand the MVP pattern and build your own MVP-based application:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mvp-example.git
